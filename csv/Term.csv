So likewise a levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed on the other side But a samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was; and when he saw him he had compassion, and went to him and bound up his wonds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own breast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And the next day he took two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper saying, 'Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.' Which of these three do you think proved neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers? The man replied, 'The one who showed mercy on him.' and Jesus said, 'Go and do likewise.'"""
